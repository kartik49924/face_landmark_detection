# face_landmark_detection

This piece of code taken from [this]() webpage with slight changes basically does 2 tasks-
1. It detects and localise face(s) in the input image.
2. It identifies and locates different landmarks (eye, nose, jawline, etc) for each face and store them in a .csv file for further usage.

Following image explains the location of each landmark point:
